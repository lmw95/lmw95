# A little bit about ✨ moi ✨
---
Hello! I'm Lydia. Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I am currently studying to become a Full Stack Developer with [Code Institute.](https://codeinstitute.net/) MyJprevious job came to a grinding halt during the UK'S COVID-19 lockdown, so I decided it was time for a change and started my career switch journey. 

So far, I have learnt so much in terms of language basics, high level concepts and how to execute a project to the end. However, I am only at the start of my journey, there is still so much to discover.
